          When a shipping vessel travels through areas in the Caribbean that are
          controlled by the countries in the European Union, it requires that
          the postal code of the consignee to be provided on the B/L. Any
          violation of this requirement may result in a penalty charge to the
          consignee at the port of discharge. Please be informed that even
          though in the past you may have successfully imported a vehicle
          without providing your postal code, it does not guarantee that it will
          not be needed in the future shipments as the sailing route of each
          shipping vessel is different.
