          No, we do not provide receipts. The bank remittance provides an
          official written record of the payment transaction for both the buyer
          and seller.

          Please allow a minimum of three (3) business days for your bank
          remittance to be acknowledged in our bank account. While this delay
          may cause some inconvenience, it is the average amount of time

          No. We accept only the bank remittance payment method because it

          the payment transaction.
