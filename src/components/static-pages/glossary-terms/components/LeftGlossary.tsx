          B/L

        <p className="text-black text-sm">
          Bill of Lading, sometimes abbreviated as B/L or BOL, is one of the
          most important documents in the shipping process. To ship any goods, a
          B/L is required and will be issued by the freight carrier or their
          agent to the shipper or their agent, and it works as Receipt of Goods,
          Evidence of Contract of Carriage between the freight carrier and the
          shipper, and Document of Title to the goods. A completed B/L legally
          shows that the carrier has received the freight as described and is
          obligated to deliver that freight in good condition to the consignee.
          The information in the B/L is critical as it directs the actions of
          personnel all along the route of the shipment - where it is going, the
          piece count, how it is billed, and how it is to be handled on the dock
          and trailers. The original B/L must be presented in order to release
          the cargo at the destination to the consignee on delivery.
