          pre-export inspections lists, please visit the appropriate government
          authorities of your country. References to these authorities can be
          found in our FAQ section “Country Regulations”. Prior to importing a
          vehicle, we strongly suggested you to please research about what is
          expected of you as a vehicle importer in your country, and you should
          understand all its risks and responsibilities.

          Does the FOB price on JAN JAPAN website include the additional costs
          like freight charge, storage charge, fees, tax and duties, etc.?
        </h3>

          No, our FOB price does not include any of these fees. The term “FOB
          Price”, as seen on JAN JAPAN website, refers to the vehicle price
          only. Any freight charges will be added to the FOB price when you
          purchase the vehicle from us. After receiving the vehicle, you will be
          responsible for paying any port clearing costs, import duties, taxes
          and any others fees required by your country and/or the port of
          discharge. Please contact your local authorities or a reputable
          clearing agent for further details. Please be informed that our
          trained agents are also available to assist you as the clearing
          agents. Here is the list of the ports we use for the shipment of the
